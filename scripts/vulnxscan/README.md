## Getting Started
To get started, follow the [Getting Started](../../README.md#getting-started) section from the main [README](../../README.md).

## Example Target
In the below examples, we use `git` as an example target for `vulnxscan`.
To print `git` drv-path on your local system, try:
```bash
$ nix eval -f '<nixpkgs>' 'git.drvPath'
"/nix/store/ay9sn71cssl4wd7s6bd8xah0zcwqiq2q-git-2.41.0.drv"
```

## Supported Scanners
### Nix and OSV Vulnerability Database
[OSV](https://osv.dev/) is a vulnerability database for open-source projects [initiated by Google](https://security.googleblog.com/2021/02/launching-osv-better-vulnerability.html). 

[OSV database](https://osv.dev/list?ecosystem=) currently [does not support Nix ecosystem](https://ossf.github.io/osv-schema/#affectedpackage-field), so queries that specify Nix as ecosystem would not return any matches. For this reason `vulnxscan` currently does not use Google's official [OSV-Scanner](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/12/announcing-osv-scanner-vulnerability.html) front-end, but implements it's own OSV client demo in [osv.py](./osv.py).

`osv.py` sends queries to [OSV API](https://osv.dev/docs/) without specifying the ecosystem, only the target package name and version. At the time of writing, such queries to OSV API return vulnerabilities that match the given package and version across all ecosystems. As a result, the OSV vulnerabilities for Nix ecosystem will include false positives. 

Also, it is worth mentioning that OSV queries without ecosystem are undocumented in the [API specification](https://osv.dev/docs/#tag/api/operation/OSV_QueryAffected) currently.

### Nix and Grype
[Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) is a vulnerability scanner targeted for container images. It uses the vulnerability data from [variety of publicly available data sources](https://github.com/anchore/grype#grypes-database). Grype also [supports input from CycloneDX SBOM](https://github.com/anchore/grype#supported-sources) which makes it possible to use Grype with SBOM input from `sbomnix`, thus, allowing Grype scans against Nix targets.

### Vulnix
[Vulnix](https://github.com/nix-community/vulnix) is a vulnerability scanner intended for Nix targets. It uses [NIST NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln) vulnerability database.

Vulnix matches vulnerabilities based on [heuristic](https://github.com/flyingcircusio/vulnix/blob/f56f3ac857626171b95e51d98cb6874278f789d3/src/vulnix/derivation.py#L104), which might result more false positives compared to direct match. False positives due to rough heuristic are an [intended feature](https://github.com/flyingcircusio/vulnix#whitelisting) in vulnix. On the other hand, vulnix accounts [CVE patches](https://github.com/flyingcircusio/vulnix#cve-patch-auto-detection) applied on Nix packages when matching vulnerabilities, something currently not directly supported by other scanners.

## Vulnxscan Usage Examples

### Running Vulnxscan as Flake
`vulnxscan` can be run as a [Nix flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) from the `tiiuae/sbomnix` repository:
```bash
# '--' signifies the end of argument list for `nix`.
# '--help' is the first argument to `vulnxscan`
$ nix run github:tiiuae/sbomnix#vulnxscan -- --help
```

or from a local repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tiiuae/sbomnix
$ cd sbomnix
$ nix run .#vulnxscan -- --help
```

### Running from Nix Development Shell

If you have nix flakes [enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes), start a development shell:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tiiuae/sbomnix
$ cd sbomnix
$ nix develop
```

You can also use `nix-shell` to enter the development shell:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tiiuae/sbomnix
$ cd sbomnix
$ nix-shell
```

From the development shell, run `vulnxscan` as follows:
```bash
$ vulnxscan.py --help
```

### Find Vulnerabilities Impacting Runtime Dependencies

INFO     Wrote: vulns.csv
```

As printed in the console output, `vulnxscan` first creates an SBOM, then feeds the SBOM (or target path) as input to different vulnerability scanners: [vulnix](https://github.com/nix-community/vulnix), [grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype), and [osv.py](https://github.com/tiiuae/sbomnix/blob/main/scripts/vulnxscan/osv.py) and creates a summary report. The summary report lists the newest vulnerabilities on top, with the `sum` column indicating how many scanners agreed with the exact same finding. In addition to the console output, `vulnxscan` writes the report to csv-file `vulns.csv` to allow easier post-processing of the output.

It is worth mentioning that `vulnxscan` filters out vulnerabilities that it detects are patched, as printed out in the console output on lines like '`CVE-2023-2975 for 'openssl' is patched with: ['/nix/store/7gz0nj14469r9dlh8p0j5w5wjj3b6hw4-CVE-2023-2975.patch']`'.
This patch auto-detection works in the similar way as the [patch auto-detection on vulnix](https://github.com/nix-community/vulnix#cve-patch-auto-detection), that is, it is based on detecting vulnerability identifiers from the patch filenames.


### Whitelisting Vulnerabilities
`vulnxscan` supports whitelisting vulnerabilities to exclude false positives, unfixable issues, or vulnerabilities known to be addressed. Whitelist is a csv file that contains rules for the vulnerabilities to be excluded from the vulnxscan console report. Consider the following example whitelist:

```
$ csvlook whitelist.csv 

| vuln_id        | package   | comment                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MAL-2022-4301  |           | Incorrect package: Issue refers npm libidn2, not libidn2.               |
| CVE-2016-2781  | coreutils | NVD data issue: CPE entry does not correctly state the version numbers. |
| CVE-20.*       | git       | Incorrect package: Impacts Jenkins git plugin, not git.                 |
```

`vuln_id` and `comment` are mandatory columns. `vuln_id` specifies a regular expression that will be used to match the vulnerability identification (`vuln_id`) against that of the `vulnxscan` output. Vulnerabilities that match the regular expression are excluded from the `vulnxscan` console output. If the whitelist includes a `package` column, in addition to matching `vuln_id`, a strict match is required against the `package` field in `vulnxscan` output.

In case many rules match a vulnerability, rules on top of the whitelist are given higher priority.

To be able to verify which vulnerabilities are whitelisted, `vulnxscan` csv output `vulns.csv` includes both whitelisted and non-whitelisted vulnerabilities implied with boolean column `whitelist`. `vulns.csv` also incluces the `comment` section from the whitelist to be able to verify the reason for whitelisting each vulnerability. Below example shows applying the above example whitelist against the `git` vulnxscan output from the earlier example.

```bash
# Given the whitelist.csv contents:
$ cat whitelist.csv 
"vuln_id","package","comment"
"MAL-2022-4301",,"Incorrect package: Issue refers npm libidn2, not libidn2."
"CVE-2016-2781","coreutils","NVD data issue: CPE entry does not correctly state the version numbers."
"CVE-20.* ","git","Incorrect package: Impacts Jenkins git plugin, not git."

# Apply the whitelist to git vulnxscan output

### Find Vulnerabilities Given SBOM as Input
This example shows how to use `vulnxscan` to summarize vulnerabilities impacting components in the given CycloneDX SBOM.

First, we use `sbomnix` to generate SBOM for the example target:
```bash
$ nix run .#sbomnix /nix/store/ay9sn71cssl4wd7s6bd8xah0zcwqiq2q-git-2.41.0.drv
..
INFO     Wrote: sbom.cdx.json
```

Then, give the generated SBOM as input to `vulnxscan`:
```bash
$ nix run .#vulnxscan -- --sbom sbom.cdx.json

INFO     Running grype scan
INFO     Running OSV scan
INFO     Querying vulnerabilities
INFO     Console report

Potential vulnerabilities impacting components in 'sbom.cdx.json':

| vuln_id       | url                                            | package   | version | grype | osv | sum |
|---------------+------------------------------------------------+-----------+---------+-------+-----+-----|
| CVE-2023-3817 | https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-3817 | openssl   | 3.0.9   |   1   |  0  |  1  |
| CVE-2023-2975 | https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2975 | openssl   | 3.0.9   |   1   |  0  |  1  |
| MAL-2022-4301 | https://osv.dev/MAL-2022-4301                  | libidn2   | 2.3.4   |   0   |  1  |  1  |
| CVE-2016-2781 | https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-2781 | coreutils | 9.3     |   1   |  0  |  1  |

INFO     Wrote: vulns.csv
```
Notice that `vulnxscan` drops the vulnix scan when the input is SBOM. This is due to the vulnix not supporting SBOM input at the time of writing.

Also notice that `vulnxscan` drops the patch auto-detection if the input is SBOM. Reason is that `vulnxscan` reads the patch information from nix derivations. Therefore, the patch information is only available when the given input is Nix store path (e.g. derivation or out-path), not SBOM.


### Find Vulnerabilities Impacting Buildtime and Runtime Dependencies
By default, `vulnxscan` scans the given target for vulnerabilities that impact its runtime-only dependencies. This example shows how to use `vulnxscan` to include also buildtime dependencies to the scan.

```bash
$ nix run .#vulnxscan -- ./result --buildtime

# ... output not included in this snippet ... 
```

### Using Whitelist to Record Manual Analysis Results
`vulnxscan` supports using whitelist csv file as a more generic record of manual analysis results, by allowing non-whitelisting rules. That is, the whitelist csv file can include a boolean `whitelist` column to indicate if the matching vulnerabilities should be whitelisted or not. The default value for `whitelist` is True, that is, if the `whitelist` column is missing or the value is empty, `vulnxscan` evaluates the rule as if the `whitelist` column value would evaluate to True.

As an example, consider the following manual analysis record (i.e. 'whitelist'):

```
csvlook manual_analysis.csv 

| vuln_id        | whitelist | package   | comment                                                            |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CVE-2022-0856  |     False | libcaca   | Not fixed upstream: https://github.com/cacalabs/libcaca/issues/65. |
| CVE-2021-32490 |     False | djvulibre | Pending merge: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/246773.       |
```

The above example `manual_analysis.csv` includes two rules: one for `CVE-2022-0856` and one for `CVE-2021-32490`. For both, the `whitelist` column value is '`False`', indicating the rule is a non-whitelisting rule. This means, for both cases, we want to record the manual analysis results as detailed in the `comment` column, but we don't want to whitelist the matching vulnerabilities. Specifically, in the case of `CVE-2022-0856` we don't want to whitelist the issue since it's not fixed upstream, but we still want to record the link to the upstream PR to make it easier to follow the upstream progress. In the case of `CVE-2021-32490` we don't want to whitelist the issue since the nixpkgs PR is pending merge. In this case too, we still want to record the nixpkgs PR to allow following the progress.

### Triage to Help Manual Analysis
`vulnxscan` can be used to help manual analysis with `--triage` and `--nixprs` command line options.

With command line option `--triage`, `vulnxscan` queries repology.org for nix-unstable and package upstream version information, as well as the CVE impacted versions. With the additional information from repology.org, `vulnxscan` classifies each vulnerability accordingly.

Consider the following example, using [ghaf](https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf) as target:

```bash
# In devshell

# Get the target drv path for a specific flake target:
$ nix eval github:tiiuae/ghaf?ref=main#packages.x86_64-linux.generic-x86_64-release.drvPath
"/nix/store/5fjfirqjsxggkx4k8ylrrrjar1c54zxp-nixos-disk-image.drv"

# Run vulnxscan:
#  --buildtime: Scan buildtime dependencies. Scanning buildtime dependencies does not
#               require building the target, which allows relatively quick scan also for
#               targets not built earlier. Notice: nix 'buildtime' dependencies are a
#               superset of runtime dependencies.
#  --whitelist: Use 'manual_analysis.csv' as a whitelist file.
#  --triage   : Help manual analysis by querying version info from repology.org.

```

As an example, the output table states the following:
- Package `qemu` 8.0.2, which is a dependency to ghaf, is potentially vulnerable to CVE-2023-40360.
- Based on repology.org, `qemu` newest version in nix-unstable is 8.0.4. Also, based on repology.org, latest `qemu` version in the `qemu` upstream is 8.1.0.
- Since both `qemu` 8.0.2 and 8.0.4 are vulnerable to CVE-2023-40360, but the upstream version 8.1.0 is not vulnerable, `vulnxscan` classifies the issue as `fix_update_to_version_upstream`.
- Package `xterm` version 379 is potentially vulnerable to CVE-2023-40359. Latest version of `xterm` in nix-unstable is 384, which is not vulnerable to CVE-2023-40359. Therefore, `vulnxscan` classifies the issue as `fix_update_to_version_nixpkgs`.
- Package `giflib` version 5.2.1 is potentially vulnerable to CVE-2023-39742. Since there's no known fixed version available in nix-unstable or the package upstream, `vulnxscan` classifies the issue as `fix_not_available`. Notice that the classification is based only on the version numbers. Indeed, it's still possible that there's an upstream patch available in an unreleased version of `giflib` that would fix the issue.
- Package `pixman` version 0.42.2 is potentially vulnerable to CVE-2023-37769. However, based on repology.org, the vulnerability [does not impact](https://repology.org/project/pixman/cves?version=0.42.2) the given version of `pixman`. Therefore, `vulnxscan` classifies the issue as `err_not_vulnerable_based_on_repology`.

##### Nixpkgs PR Search

With command line option `--nixprs`, `vulnxscan` queries github for nixpkgs PRs that might include more information concerning possible nixpkgs fixes for the found vulnerabilities. `--nixprs` adds URLs to (at most five) PRs that appear valid for each vulnerability based on heuristic. The PR search takes significant time due to github API rate limits, which is why it is not enabled by default.

Consider the following example, using the same Ghaf target as earlier:

```bash
# Run vulnscan with --triage and --nixprs
$ vulnxscan.py /nix/store/5fjfirqjsxggkx4k8ylrrrjar1c54zxp-nixos-disk-image.drv --buildtime --whitelist=manual_analysis.csv --triage --nixprs

`vulnxscan` option `--nixprs` adds the column `nixpkgs_pr` to the output, to help manual analysis by listing PRs that appear relevant for the given issue.

## Footnotes and Future Work

For now, consider `vulnxscan` as a demonstration. Some improvement ideas are listed below:
 - Consider adding patch information to SBOM (e.g. via the [pedigree](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/#pedigree) attribute) to be able to auto-detect patched vulnerabilities also when the input is SBOM.
 - Vulnerability scanners lack support for parsing the patch data: even if `sbomnix` added the patch data to the output SBOM, we suspect not many vulnerability scanners would read the information. As an example, the following discussion touches this topic on DependencyTrack: https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/919.
 - Identifying packages is hard as pointed out in https://discourse.nixos.org/t/the-future-of-the-vulnerability-roundups/22424/5. As an example, CPEs are inaccurate which causes issues in matching vulnerabilities: https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/discussions/2290.
 - Nix ecosystem is not supported in OSV: the way `osv.py` makes use of OSV data for Nix targets -- as explained in section [Nix and OSV vulnerability database](#nix-and-osv-vulnerability-database) -- makes the reported OSV vulnerabilities include false positives.

### Other Future Work
- [vulnxscan](./vulnxscan.py) uses vulnix from a [forked repository](https://github.com/henrirosten/vulnix), to include vulnix support for [scanning runtime-only dependencies](https://github.com/flyingcircusio/vulnix/compare/master...henrirosten:vulnix:master).
- [vulnxscan](./vulnxscan.py) could include more scanners in addition to [vulnix](https://github.com/flyingcircusio/vulnix), [grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype), and [osv.py](https://github.com/tiiuae/sbomnix/blob/main/scripts/vulnxscan/osv.py). Suggestions for other open-source scanners, especially those that can digest CycloneDX or SPDX SBOMs are welcome. Consider e.g. [bombon](https://github.com/nikstur/bombon) and [cve-bin-tool](https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool). Adding cve-bin-tool to vulnxscan was [demonstrated](https://github.com/tiiuae/sbomnix/pull/75) earlier, but not merged due to reasons explained in the [PR](https://github.com/tiiuae/sbomnix/pull/75#issuecomment-1670958503).
